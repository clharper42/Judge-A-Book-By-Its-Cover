# Judge-A-Book-By-Its-Cover
Choose between two book covers that are from books pulled from 'good subjects' and after a certain amount of selections you are given a book based off of your choices

After making a selection the subjects of the chosen book are compared to the subjects of the non-selected book and are placed into 'good subjects' and 'bad subjects' respectfully.

For selections beyond the first remove from 'good subjects' what subjects show up in the non-selected book and vice versa. Also, add to both 'good subjects' and 'bad subjets' what was not there before the new selection.

After x amount of selections take a random subject from 'good subjects' and dispaly a book that links to its Open Library page that has no subjects that show up in 'bad subjects'
